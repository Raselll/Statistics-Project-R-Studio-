# Statistics-Project
I carry out a study on 4 variables that can affect the energy efficiency of vehicles in terms of fuel consumption and then I determine a statistical model to predict the fuel efficiency of a vehicle from certain relevant characteristics. In total, 8 models were made and the best of them was picked . 

Notions aboarded in Probability and Statistics class were aboarded, and the entire project was coded using R-Studio.
Notions seen :
- Correlations matrices
- Diagrams (Histograms, Turkeys Diagrams, Henry's plot line)
- Confidence Interval (L/U)
- Hypothetical tests
- Analyse of models
- Signification tests (Residuals vs Fitted, Normal Q-Q, Scale-Location et Residuals vs Leverage)
